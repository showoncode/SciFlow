# ✨ SciFlow: Revolutionizing Academic Writing and Publishing

**SciFlow** is an innovative, decentralized platform that streamlines the academic writing, collaboration, and publishing process. It empowers researchers, educators, and students through AI-assisted tools, real-time collaboration features, and blockchain-based intellectual property management.

SciFlow combines Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain with a powerful web interface to enable transparent governance, secure data storage, and NFT-based ownership of research outputs.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Authoring**:  
   Use the web-based editor to collaboratively write, cite, and format academic content.

2. **IP Registration**:  
   Mint a Clarity-based NFT representing the work’s metadata and ownership hash.

3. **Governance Participation**:  
   Token holders can vote on platform upgrades, community funds, and publishing incentives.

4. **Publishing & Sharing**:  
   Export to multiple formats and publish on institutional repositories or decentralized platforms.

## 🧪 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Clarinet (Stacks smart contract toolchain)
- Hiro Wallet (for signing and interacting with contracts)
- IPFS daemon (optional for decentralized file storage)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/sciflow.git
cd sciflow
npm install
````

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Running the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Working with Clarity Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
clarinet check           # Type-check your contracts
clarinet test            # Run unit tests
clarinet deploy          # Deploy contracts to localnet or testnet
```

## 📜 Example Use Case: Minting a Paper NFT

1. User writes a paper and saves it.
2. The paper is hashed (SHA-256) and registered on-chain via a Clarity NFT contract.
3. The minted NFT represents ownership and includes metadata like:

   * Title, DOI, abstract
   * Authors' public addresses
   * License (e.g., CC-BY, MIT)
4. The NFT can then be:

   * Transferred to a university wallet
   * Licensed for reuse with embedded smart contract logic
   * Traded on NFT marketplaces

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

* **No sensitive data stored on-chain** — only cryptographic hashes and metadata.
* **Role-based access control** for document collaboration and reviews.
* **IPFS/Filecoin** ensure decentralized, verifiable, and optionally private file storage.
* **Open-source smart contracts** ensure transparent governance and NFT logic.
